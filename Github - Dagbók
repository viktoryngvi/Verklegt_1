Git and the Diary: Each group must use a version control utility (i.e., Git) and the group MUST
keep a diary that is committed to Git every day. Every day the group should have a meeting to
update the diary and after that meeting a new diary entry should be committed to Git with the
following information:
• Date and time and who was in attendance (on-site and/or remote).
• A summary of “State of the project” since last meeting. This can include stuff like listing
completed tasks, list any issues discovered and/or any other issues that are worth discussing
with the whole group.
• “ToDo-lists”: Depending on how the group is organizing (one person or working in pairs), there
should be one ToDo-list of task to be worked on today for each person/subgroup. ToDo-lists
should be prioritized and the goal is to keep everyone working on what is needed next and so
everyone knows what task to do. Make the list to long rather than to short as it is fine to not
finish the list every time. Next meeting you just update them by adding task and changing
priority.
• “State of the group”: Use this section to list comments, disagreements, summarize you meeting
discussion and write down questions for the teacher and/or TA’s. This is your chance to
document how the group work is going overall (remember you hand in the Diary and it is used
in grading).
